What is Scratch

Scratch is a free object-oriented software development kit (SDK) that allows children age 8-16 to create animations, interactive stories, games and music without needing to know a specific programming language. Scratch, which consists of a script, paint and sound editor, is maintained by the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab and features an online community to encourage collaboration among young programmers.
